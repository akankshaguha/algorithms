#Algorithms

This is a WIP.

Its basically solution for most of the algorithms which are covered in Coursera Alogrithm(I,II) tutorial
Language used for solving the algoritms is Scala.

## PS.
I wanted to learn scala, implementing algorithms is the best choise when you want to explore a language :-)
