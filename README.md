#Algorithms

This is a WIP.

Its basically solution for most of the algorithms which are covered in Coursera Algorithm(I,II) tutorial
Language used for solving the algorithms is Scala.

## PS.
I wanted to learn scala, implementing algorithms is the best choice when you want to explore a language :-)
